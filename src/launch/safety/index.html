            The absence of gravity in space can cause a variety of problems for humans, including muscle and bone loss, and other physiological changes. It can also make it difficult to perform tasks and move around, as objects do not behave in the same way they do on Earth. Not to worry though because due to our patented <strong style="font-family: Nova;">Bone Restore</strong> technology rockets, humans will still be able to live as if they would be around gravity. Working along with Space X, we were able to devolop many solutions one being our specialzed regen suits built for recovery.

            Space is filled with high-energy particles that can be harmful to humans. These particles can damage DNA and other cellular structures, and increase the risk of cancer and other diseases. Thanks to the <strong style="font-family: Nova;">Radionite</strong> fabric that covers the interior of our spacecraft, we can maintain safety standards that are within those of the CDC in terms of radiation.

          Small rocks and debris pose a threat to spacecraft and humans in space. Even relatively small meteoroids can  cause significant damage to spacecraft and other objects. We have fortified our spacecraft with our  proprietary <strong style="font-family: Nova;">AstroMesh</strong> metal alloys that will help ensure foreign  objects do not harm the exterior of the aircraft. Our reinforced tungsten composite ensures that no sized  meteroid can cause damage to the exterior of our rocket ship.

          Space travelers may feel claustrophobic and uncomfortable in a limited living space, especially during long-duration missions. Lift has designed spacious and modular habitats that can be reconfigured to meet the changing needs of the astronauts. Additionally, we use virtual reality technology to create an illusion of larger living spaces.

          The isolation, confinement, and lack of social interaction in space can cause psychological stress among astronauts. Lift provides virtual reality experiences that simulate natural environments such as forests or beaches, to help astronauts feel more connected to Earth. Additionally, Lift offers support services such as counseling and mental health resources to help astronauts cope with the stress of long-duration missions.

          Communication delays between Earth and space can be a major concern for space travelers, especially in emergency situations. Lift has worked with many comm tech companies to develop advanced communication technologies such as faster communication systems or artificial intelligence-based communication systems that could assist space travelers in communicating with Earth more efficiently.

          In space, resources such as food, water, and air are limited. Lift has come up with sustainable solutions such as hydroponic farming, water recycling systems, and air purification systems. These solutions would not only provide the necessary resources for space travelers but also reduce the cost of space travel by decreasing the need to transport resources from Earth.
