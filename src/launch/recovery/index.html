          Try Meditation!

        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>Meditation is a powerful and effective way to relax, not only for people on Earth but for space people as well. It is a technique that has been practiced for thousands of years, and has proven benefits for both the mind and body.

            In space, where there are no distractions from the outside world, meditation can be an especially effective way to achieve a state of deep relaxation. By focusing on the present moment and letting go of thoughts and worries, astronauts and space travelers can experience a sense of peace and tranquility that can help them cope with the stress and isolation of space travel.
            
            Meditation has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety, improve sleep quality, and enhance overall wellbeing. It can also improve cognitive function, including concentration, memory, and creativity. These benefits can be especially important for space travelers, who face unique challenges and stresses that can take a toll on their mental and physical health.

          What do our Astronauts think?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>As an astronaut, re-entering space after being on Earth can be an awe-inspiring experience. The sheer vastness and beauty of the universe never cease to amaze me, even after countless missions.

            As we climb higher and higher into the atmosphere, I can feel the gravity of the Earth releasing its GRIPPERS on me. It's an indescribable feeling, like being weightless and free, as if I am finally breaking free from the constraints of my earthly existence.
            
            As we breach the atmosphere and enter space, I am struck by the beauty of the cosmos. The darkness is dotted with millions of stars, each one shining bright and beautiful in its own right. It's a humbling experience, to realize just how small we are in the grand scheme of things.
            
            As we orbit the Earth, I can see our planet in all its glory. The blues and greens of the oceans, the white of the clouds, and the browns and greens of the continents all blend together in a beautiful mosaic. I feel a sense of responsibility to protect this precious planet, to preserve it for generations to come.
            
            Finally, as we prepare to re-enter the atmosphere, I feel a sense of relief mixed with excitement. It's a bumpy ride, as the spacecraft shakes and rattles against the friction of the atmosphere. But as we finally touch down on the surface of the Earth, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment and wonder at the incredible experience I have just had.- Lift astronaut</p>

        <p class="py-4">The recovery process for astronauts after returning from space is a critical aspect of spaceflight. According to experts, astronauts have to go through a period of rest and recovery to help their bodies readjust to Earth's gravity and overcome the physical and psychological effects of spaceflight. During spaceflight, astronauts are exposed to a range of physiological stresses, including muscle and bone loss, cardiovascular changes, and changes in the immune system. To recover from these effects, astronauts need to engage in a range of physical and mental activities designed to promote healing and adaptation.
