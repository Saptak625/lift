        <strong>Follow the instructions of the spacecraft crew and listen to any announcements that are made.</strong> The crew will be responsible for managing the spacecraft's systems and ensuring a safe return to Earth.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Stay seated and strapped in during the descent back to Earth.</strong> The spacecraft will experience high G-forces during re-entry, and it's important to remain in your seat to avoid injury.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Stay calm and try to relax.</strong> The return journey can be stressful, but it's important to remain calm and follow the crew's instructions.

        <p class="text-base-400">Here at LIFT, recovery is a seamless and technologically advanced process. The spacecraft is equipped with advanced materials that allow for a smooth re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, eliminating the need for traditional heat shields. Instead, the vehicle utilizes a combination of advanced aerodynamics and propulsion systems to maneuver itself safely back to Earth. Once landed, autonomous drones and robots are immediately deployed to retrieve the spacecraft and transport it back to our state-of-the-art facilities for decontamination and maintenance. Our advanced monitoring systems also allow us to remotely track the spacecraft's every movement and make real-time adjustments to its flight path, ensuring a safe and efficient return journey. Passengers can also expect a comfortable and luxurious experience, with advanced in-flight entertainment systems and virtual reality capabilities to make the recovery process as enjoyable as possible.</p>
