      <p class="text-md md:text-2xl font-light ">The training required of our customers is designed to be challenging
        but intuitive to prepare them for the demands of our wonderful trip. Lift space training, also known as
        SpaceCamp™️, is a 4-week program that takes place at the Galileo facilities in San Diego, California, or Parris
        Island, South Carolina. The training includes physical conditioning, cardiovascular training, and instruction in
        our unique and innovative Lift spacecraft. After completing SpaceCamp™️, some individuals may receive additional
        training. This training is to make sure everyone is ready for the exciting adventure ahead. This training may be
        technical, such as learning how to operate and function within space, but the goal of this mandatory training is
        to ensure that our customers have a better experience during their LIFT trip.</p>

      <br>
      <p class="text-md md:text-2xl font-light ">Fitness screening for space travelers is a crucial step in ensuring the
        safety and success of space missions. The screening process aims to identify any potential health risks that
        could arise from exposure to the unique environment of space, such as microgravity and radiation. These risks
        can include cardiovascular issues, bone and muscle loss, and changes in vision. Additionally, the screening
        process evaluates the overall physical and mental health of the individual, including their fitness level,
        medical history, and any pre-existing conditions.
        As astronaut Clayton Anderson once said, "You cannot afford to be sick in space. It's not like being on Earth.
        Spaceflight can be detrimental to your health. You must be in optimal physical condition." Therefore, the
        fitness screening process plays a critical role in ensuring that space travelers are prepared to handle the
        physical and mental demands of space travel.

        training. Space tourists will need to receive basic training in the principles of space travel, including the
        effects of microgravity on the body and safety protocols. The participants need to be ready for the changes that
        space has on the body. Additionally, the participants will go through a mission-specific training in which they
        will receive special training for the particular mission/package they choose. Space tourists will need to know
        how to operate any equipment or perform any tasks that may be required during their space travel experience.</p>

        emergency while in space. Training may include simulations of various emergency scenarios and drills to practice
        emergency procedures. This emergency training consists of different simulations that depict a real-like scene in
        which the tourist must be able perform the correct duties in the case of an emergency.</p>
