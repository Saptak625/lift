            <p class=" text-2xl font-light ">The training required of our customers is designed to be challenging but intuitive to prepare them for the demands <br> of our wonderful trip. Lift space training, also known as SpaceCamp™️, is a 4-week program that takes place at the Galileo facilities <br> in San Diego, California, or Parris Island, South Carolina. The training includes physical conditioning, cardiovascular training, <br> and instruction in our unique and innovative Lift spacecraft. After completing SpaceCamp™️, some individuals may receive additional training. <br> This training is to make sure everyone is ready for the exciting adventure ahead. This training may be technical, such as learning how to operate <br> and function within space, but the goal of this mandatory training is to ensure that our customers have a better experience during their LIFT trip.

            <p class=" text-2xl font-light "> Re-entry into Earth's atmosphere can be a challenging process for astronauts returning from space. The transition from the microgravity environment of space to Earth's gravity and atmospheric pressure can have a significant impact on the body, causing physical and emotional challenges. However, with advanced technology and expert guidance, the process can be made smoother and less stressful</p>

          <br><br>
          <p class=" text-2xl font-light "> The next step of space training will include basic space travel training.  Space tourists will need to receive basic training in the principles of space travel, including the effects of microgravity on the body and safety protocols. The participants need to be ready for the changes that space has on the body. Additionally, the participants will go through a mission-specific training in which they will receive special training for the particular mission/package they choose. Space tourists will need to know how to operate any equipment or perform any tasks that may be required during their space travel experience.

          <p class=" text-2xl font-light "> In the third stage of training, we will train the participants to be ready for space and its environment. This includes different simulations that will portray different possible scenarios in the case of an emergency.  It's important that space tourists know how to respond in the event of an emergency while in space. Training may include simulations of various emergency scenarios and drills to practice emergency procedures. This emergency training consists of different simulations that depict a real-like scene in which the tourist must be able to perform the correct duties in the case of an emergency.

          <p class=" text-2xl font-light "> In the last part of the training, the tourists will undergo more simulations that depict the gravity-less environment of space. This last part of the training will include a full review of the training program as well as a rehearsal of the actual launch. This will ensure that all the participants are ready for the launch on its specified date.
